These are the results of correlating (pearson correlation) forward recall performance with backward recall performance:
The first row is for sighted. The second is for blind. 
The first column is for % positions correct. The second is for % letters correct
Rho:
0.46105     0.43659
0.31376    0.091846
P-values:

%Q: The next few lines are code. Please write txt files that only contain output and not code. That will give me less to keep track of.
